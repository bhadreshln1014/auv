Hi there! My name is Bhadresh. I am a second year DD CSE student at IIITDM.
I started my coding journey only after coming here. Since then, I've solved a lot of problems, participating in initiatives like the POTD conducted in our first year.
I also started learning backend coding (in Python Django) very recently, and I hope to progress in that as well.
I like problem solving in general. I sit and break my head over a problem until I get it right
I hope to learn a lot of fun stuff in the future too :)
